# Memory Game

This is a [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/react-new-memory-card) curriculum project made by using React.

## Project Goals

Demonstrate basic concepts of building a React app, like:

- Creating components.
- Using state to control said components.
- Passing state to children components and back up the chain.
- Using effect to make an API call to fetch photos from Flickr.

## Game description

It is a memory game where 12 photos appear and the player has to click on them consecutively, each only once. After each click the photos get shuffled. If a photo is clicked more than once score resets.

Here is a [live version](https://deluxe-pastelito-751e93.netlify.app/) of the game.

Enjoy!
